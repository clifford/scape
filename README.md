# Scape

Scape uses the
[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) analyzer to
emit [Datomic](http://datomic.com) transaction data containing useful
information about some ClojureScript codebase and putting the data in
a datomic database so the program becomes queriable via datalog. The
idea is to extract interesting statistics and facts about
ClojureScript programs.

This is work in progress. Take a look at
[core.clj](https://github.com/jonase/scape/blob/master/src/scape/core.clj)
and
[emitter.clj](https://github.com/jonase/scape/blob/master/src/scape/emitter.clj)
if you're interested to see how it works.
